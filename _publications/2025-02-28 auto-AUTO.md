auto-AUTO (or AUTO2) is a Python package that acts as an intermediate layer between the user and AUTO-07p continuation software (Doedel et al., 2007) (AUTO from here on). auto-AUTO automates the running of AUTO by monitoring the continuation, while also keeping track of bifurcation points. The package can automatically continue along these branching points, and continue branching along further bifurcation points to attempt to construct full bifurcation trees. To achieve this in a reliable way, AUTO computations are managed by auto-AUTO by setting appropriate stopping conditions, such as meeting other branches, looping branches, and specified bifurcations. These stopping conditions supplement the usual AUTO bounds and ensure that branches of detected solutions are unique and well defined.

Education
======
* Ph.D in climate modelling with a focus on climate tipping points, *Université Catholique de Louvain*, 2021 - Ongoing
* M.Sc. in Mathematical Modelling, *University College London*, 2020
* B.A. Mathematics & Philosophy, *Trinity College Dublin*, 2017

Research Work
======
**Climate Change Impact on Atmospheric Blocking (PhD)**
- Project is part of the CriticalEarth EU Horizon 2020 project researching tipping points and critical
transitions in the climate.

- The link between atmospheric blockings, or decadal variability in the extratropical atmosphere,
and unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) in climate models will be researched.

- Analysis of how UPOs are modiﬁed due to climate change will be undertaken to help understand
how climate change will aﬀect the low-frequency variability present in the atmosphere.

- This investigation will be performed in a hierarchy of climate models of increasing complexity and
using tools of nonlinear sciences


**Forest Fire Modelling (MSc Dissertation)**
- Forest fire behaviour was modelled by deriving an equation to simulate fire spread incorporating wind, topography, and fuel type.
- The equation was simulated using a variety of finite difference methods, which I programmed.
- This equation was used to implement a cellular automata model, which incorporated discrete
spreading elements such as firebreaks and floating embers.
- The model produced realistic spreading behaviour that was verified with fire spread observations.

**Automated Mapping of Transport Networks (BA Dissertation)**
- Bus network maps were automatically created given the location of bus stops and the ordering of the stops for each bus route.
- From a specified stop, the program identified key routes and output a well designed transit map.
- This project involved graph theory, graph embeddings, linear programming, and data analysis of
similarity between bus lines.
- The project produced an accurate bus and rail map for the Dublin network, given network data.


Work Experience
======

**Climate Researcher, Royal Meteorological Institute, Brussels Oct 2021 -**

Researcher of climate dynamics as part of my PhD studies.
My main tasks include analysing climate models, modifying climate models in python, and implementing
new diagnostic tools to analyse results.

**Transport Planner and Economist, WSP, London Oct 2017 - Apr 2021**

Analyst and model builder for forecasting and analysing a wide range of transport systems. Responsibilities involve model building and auditing, data analysis, and project management.

*Key Projects:*
- **Train Loadings During COVID-19 (2020):** Using ticket gate-data I developed a process to provide daily reports to Chiltern Railways on the number of people on each train. This process helped ensure social distancing could be maintained and to aid in passenger demand forecasting.
- **Overground Service Reporting (2020):** I created a process for Arriva Rail London (ARL) which incorpo- rated different datasets on timetable, performance, and planned engineering work to output a forecast for capacity for the London Overground. I also managed this project and was responsible for liaising with stakeholders within ARL and TfL.
- **Journeys per Ticket (2019):** Research project for the Department of Transport, calculating the number of journeys taken on season tickets. I created a program to search over 200 million ticket entries to identify trip rates. I also created a process to find and edit missing entries in the ticket data. Results from this project are included in the government transport guidance.
- **Carbon Emission Modelling (2018):** I built a model to forecast the emissions of rail services as part of the West Coast franchise. This involved incorporating timetable information, rolling stock types, and researching the forecast carbon emissions of the UK power grid.

**Senior Sailing Instructor, Howth Yacht Club May 2015 - Apr 2017**
*HYC Instructor of the year 2015*

I was the team leader of up to eleven instructors during summer sailing courses. I was responsible for on the water safety and maintaining the high teaching standards expected at one of Ireland’s most successful sailing clubs. I also had final say on the suitability of weather conditions and forecasts for teaching. I was in charge of handling customer feedback and administration for the courses and over three summers the club enrolled 500 students.

As well as leading sailing instructors I taught sailing for five years, during which time I taught all age groups and sailing abilities.

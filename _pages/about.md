I am moving to Christchurch, New Zealand in September 2025 and I am looking for work in academia or industry where I can apply my strong mathematical modelling and climate science background. I am an Australian citizen and do not require a visa to work in New Zealand.

An example of my resent research can be found in the journal [Chaos](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article/35/8/083126/3358767/Using-unstable-periodic-orbits-to-understand), and [here](/_publications/2025-08-14_UPOs_and_blocking) is a blog post that I wrote about it.


I studied my PhD on the topic of reduced order climate models, with a focus on abrupt changes or tipping points in the climate, and heat and cold waves in the mid-latitudes.

Some of my other achievements and background include:

- Masters degree in Mathematical Modelling from University Collage London
- Undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Philosophy at Trinity College Dublin
- Four years' experience working in economics and transport planning 
- Senior sailing instructor leading a team of 10+ instructors, Howth Yacht Club


My full CV can be found [here](cv).

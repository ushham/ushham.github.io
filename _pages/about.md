I am moving to Christchurch, New Zealand in September 2025 and I am looking for work in academia or industry where I can apply my strong mathematical modelling and climate science background.


I studied my PhD on the topic of reduced order climate models, with a focus on abrupt changes or tipping points in the climate, and heat and cold waves in the mid-latitudes.

Some of my other achievements and background include:

- MSc in Mathematical Modelling from University Collage London
- Bachelors in Mathematics and Philosophy at Trinity College Dublin
- Four years' experience working in economics and transport planning 
- Australian Citizen

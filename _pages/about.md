I received my PhD in low order climate models in 2025, from the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium and UC Louvain. I am currently based in Christchurch, New Zealand.

An example of my recent research can be found in the journal [Chaos](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article/35/8/083126/3358767/Using-unstable-periodic-orbits-to-understand), and [here](/_publications/2025-08-14_UPOs_and_blocking) is a blog post that I wrote about it.


My PhD focused on the topic of reduced order climate models, with a focus on abrupt changes or tipping points in the climate, and heat and cold waves in the mid-latitudes.

Some of my other achievements and background include:

- Masters degree in Mathematical Modelling from University College London
- Undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Philosophy at Trinity College Dublin
- Four years' experience working in economics and transport planning 
- Senior sailing instructor leading a team of 10+ instructors, Howth Yacht Club

This trip was done over 6 days, from Austria across the alps to lake Guarda in Italy.

The map was generated from gpx downloaded from strava, using the python code shared on [github](https://github.com/ushham/Strava-Data-Analysis/blob/master/RouteMapping.ipynb). The colour bar shows the elevation above sea level in metres.

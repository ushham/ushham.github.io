## <a id="behaviour">Model Behaviour</a>

Here is an animation showing the behaviour of the model over time.
On the left we show the position of the trajectory in projected phase spece, on the modes $(x, y)=(\psi_{a, 3}, \psi_{a, 2})$, which allows us to visualise....

On the right we show the 500hPa geopotential height anomaly over time.

Sweep of bifurcation diag for low values of cg to show chaos emerging.

## <a id="windward">Windward Blocking</a>

At k_d=0.08 and cg=370 there is a region where there is a stable PO.

We can extend the BD in kd and CG to find the region of stability
PICURES OF BIFURCATION DIAGRAMS

Once we leave the region of stability, through a series of PD or TR, depending on the direction we take in k_d or cg, the behaviour again becomes chaotic. However, we see that there is a persistance of the PO on the dynamics
